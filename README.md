# Flatpress to LaTeX #

This script converts posts in a flatpress blog into a .tex document.

- Can filter from date to date.
- Images within posts can be included

-- Features missing --

Right now images are included 'as is'. This script doesn't check images' orientation, so in generated .tex document you have to set how many lines to wrap around the figure.
